# Octako: Flexible building of neural networks

*Octako* is a library using Pytorch for flexible construction of complex neural networks. 

## Diving In

The word tako means octopus in Japanese, an almost alien-like animal with alien-like, distributed, flexible intelligence. Octako aims to make the 

While simple neural networks are relatively easy to build and use with standard libraries, they become harder to use as the network becomes more comples

Octako aims to make it easy to build and use complex neural networks.
