# Octako: Flexible building of neural networks

*Octako* is a library using Pytorch for flexible construction of neural networks. 

## Diving In

The word tako means octopus in Japanese, an almost alien-like animal with alien-like, distributed, flexible intelligence. With Octako you create neural networks in a "tako-like" fashion.

Octako aims to make it easy to build neural networks. Networks can be flexibly designed and queried.
